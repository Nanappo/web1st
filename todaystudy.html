    <strong><a href="http://www.w3c.org/TR/HTML" target="_blank">Hypertext Markup Language</a></strong>(<u>HTML</u>) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>
    Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.</p>
